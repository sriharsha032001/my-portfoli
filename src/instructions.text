# Cursor prompt (copy-paste ready)

**Goal:** Build a stunning, “next-level” developer portfolio website (Next.js + Tailwind) that presents the candidate’s resume, projects, achievements and contact information with exceptional UX, accessibility, performance and modern micro-interactions. Produce a production-ready single-repo scaffold (Next.js + Tailwind), full page content, component list, sample code snippets, deployment steps (Vercel), SEO/structured data, and a downloadable PDF resume. Visual style: modern, minimal, high-contrast, edge polish (subtle motion, glass/neumorphism accents, microinteractions). Provide both a one-page scrolling landing layout and a multi-page option (Home / About / Experience / Projects / Contact / Resume). Include fully written copy to paste — use the exact content below for sections.

## DELIVERABLES (what Cursor must output)

1. A ready-to-clone Git repo scaffold (Next.js + Tailwind) with components and pages described below. Include package.json, tailwind.config.js, next.config.js, and sample .env.example for contact form and analytics keys.
2. Fully written page content (HTML/JSX-ready) using the exact text in **REQUIRED CONTENT**. Provide both raw text blocks and sample React components that render them.
3. Visual design system: color palette, typography (system + Google fonts), spacing scale, and Tailwind utility classes to use. Create light and dark modes; suggest a high-contrast “signature” accent color.
4. Component list & props: Hero, Nav (sticky, hide-on-scroll), ExperienceTimeline (interactive), ProjectsGrid (filterable), SkillsCloud, CertificationsBadgeRow, ContactForm (serverless submit), ResumeDownload, Footer.
5. Microinteraction & animation plan (Framer Motion + Tailwind utilities) with exact code snippets for: animated hero heading, hover card lift, timeline enter animations, skeleton loaders, and smooth scroll.
6. Accessibility checklist & ARIA roles for all interactive components.
7. SEO & structured data: head tags, Open Graph, Twitter cards, JSON-LD for Person + Resume.
8. Performance plan: image optimization, fonts strategy, preconnect, critical CSS, Lighthouse targets & suggested audits.
9. Deployment steps: Vercel recommended config + one-click deploy, GitHub Pages fallback instructions, environment variables.
10. A downloadable PDF resume generator route (serverless) that returns a high-quality PDF version of the content.
11. Testing & CI: sample GitHub Actions workflow that runs lint, typecheck (if TS), and deploys to Vercel.
12. A short development README and a “Design Rationale” section explaining UX decisions.

## DESIGN DIRECTION (visual + interaction)

* **Overall feel:** Minimal, professional, slightly cinematic. Big typographic hero, plenty of white space, subtle depth.
* **Layout:** Split-hero (left: intro + CTAs, right: snapshot card with key stats), sticky nav, experience timeline with vertical line and animated cards, projects grid with live filters and repo links.
* **Motion:** Use subtle easing, 200–600ms durations. Use Framer Motion for entrance and hover. Avoid heavy parallax on mobile.
* **Colors & Type:** Neutral base (near-white / charcoal) + a vivid accent (e.g., electric cyan or warm gold) for CTAs. Sans-serif headline + monospaced code font for project cards.
* **Accessibility:** 4.5:1 contrast for body text; all buttons keyboard-focusable; skip-to-content link.

**SEO JSON-LD (Person + Resume snippet)** — Cursor should generate final JSON-LD using the provided content.

---

## QA / REVIEW CHECKLIST (deliver with PR)

* All text exactly matches the **REQUIRED CONTENT**.
* Mobile first: Test at 320px / 375px / 768px / 1024px.
* Lighthouse: Performance ≥90, Accessibility ≥90, Best Practices ≥90, SEO ≥90 (aim).
* Contact form successful POST to `/api/contact` and sends email or logs to configured provider.
* Resume PDF matches visual styling and includes metadata (author, title).

---

## Extra asks for Cursor (what to return)

* A zip-ready repository or GitHub repo link with everything scaffolded.
* A short “how to iterate” list so the user can quickly adjust palette, fonts, and hero text.
* A single-page mockup image (Figma-like layout) or a clear component markup for a designer to use.

# Step-by-step explanation (how I composed this prompt)

1. **Captured the goal** — The user asked for a prompt to include all resume content and make the design “next level.” I started by translating that into an actionable product goal: a Next.js + Tailwind portfolio with production readiness.
2. **Extracted exact content** — I copied the user’s resume verbatim into the **REQUIRED CONTENT** block so Cursor can paste exact text into pages/components without guessing.
3. **Specified deliverables** — I listed concrete outputs Cursor must produce (repo scaffold, components, SEO, PDF generator, deployment scripts). This transforms a vague “design” ask into implementable artifacts.
4. **Design & UX decisions** — I gave a clear visual direction and UX patterns (hero, timeline, microinteractions) so Cursor can propose a polished UI rather than a boilerplate.
5. **Implementation guidance** — I included file structure and code snippets to reduce ambiguity and speed up development.
6. **QA and deployment** — I added testing, accessibility, Lighthouse targets and deploy steps to ensure production quality.
7. **Extras & iteration** — I requested zip/Git output and iteration notes so user can continue tweaking.

# Alternative approaches you might prefer

* **Black & White minimalist theme:** Strict monochrome with accent via motion only. Great for judges who prefer print-like resumes. (If you want this, I can convert the prompt to enforce black & white styling.)
* **Interactive data CV:** Add interactive charts (skills by proficiency, timelines) and small animations showing impact metrics. Useful for data-heavy roles.
* **One-page static HTML/CSS export:** If you prefer maximum portability (host anywhere) — generate a single static HTML, CSS, JS bundle instead of Next.js.
* **Designer-first output:** Produce Figma (or Figma-style JSON) mockups and a pixel-perfect spec rather than code scaffolding — better if you want a designer to polish visuals before dev.
